# Dotfiles

These are my configuration files and scripts used to bootstrap a machine.
I created this project to help me manage all of my configurations and to more quickly and consistently bootstrap a machine from a fresh linux installation.

## Usage
Run the bootstrap script as follows to begin the bootstrapping process on your machine.
```
./bootstrap.sh
```
